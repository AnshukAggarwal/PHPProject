Description: 
The search feature is used to search for the list of jobs from the Jobs table. 
Once the user searches for a job in the search box its goes to the Search.php page where the results are displayed. 

Once user clicks any of these jobs, an AJAX request is sent to data.php which gets all the details of the job from the database and displays it on the column right side of the search result. 

On the left side the user has a set of filters which can be used to narrow down the search results. The code also calculates the number of days before which the job was posted. And on the top, thereâ€™s another small search bar which the user can use to submit another search request.
